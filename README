smbpipe (Python version)

smbpipe is an openbox pipe menu for accessing (list, mount, etc.) samba shares.
Shares containing spaces are handled.
Printers will be copied to clipboard for usage with CUPS.

Usage:
Add something like this to your menu.xml
<menu id="smbpipe" label="Samba Shares" execute="python /path/to/smbpipe.py" />
Credential files should be stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME/smbpipe as a file with the name of the server.
Do NOT forget to set the right permissions (chmod 600)
The creation of new credential files is not yet supported.

Dependencies:
python
smbclient
urxvt (should be easily replaceable with any other terminal emulator)
xclip (for copying url for CUPS to clipboard)
